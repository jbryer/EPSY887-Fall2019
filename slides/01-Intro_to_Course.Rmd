# Syllabus

Syllabus and course materials are here: [https://epsy887.bryer.org](https://epsy887.bryer.org)

The site is built using the [Blogdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/) R package and hosted on [Github](https://github.com/jbryer/EPSY887Fall2019). Each page of the site has a "Improve this page" link at the bottom right, use that to start a pull request on Github.

# Assignments

This course is graded as pass/fail. Successful students will attend and participate in the weekly classes as well as contribute to the course wiki. Weekly assignments will be assigned as appropriate. 

* **Participation** (10%) - Participate in class and the Slack discussions.
* **Labs** (20%) - R Labs will be assigned as appropriate.
* **Website** (30%) - Students are to create a website using either the `blogdown` or `bookdown` R package.
* **Presentation** (40%) - The culmination of the course will be a short (20 to 30 minutes) presentation and document outlining the analysis you conducted with your dataset. Students are encouraged to bring their own dataset (e.g. data to be used for a dissertation), but that is not necessary. Many free and public datasets are available for use and will be discussed in the first couple classes.
